This is an implementation of a Red-Black Tree in Java:

A red.black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, a 
data structure used in computer science, typically to implement 
associative arrays. 

I used this to store a large set of data that had to be "auto completed" 
over, and I didn't have the option to use a database.  This guaranteed 
that the height of the tree stayed sane.
