This is an implementation of a Red-Black Tree in Java:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree

A red.black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, a 
data structure used in computer science, typically to implement 
associative arrays. 

I used this to store a large set of data that had to be "auto completed" 
over, and I didn't have the option to use a database.  This guaranteed 
that the height of the tree stayed sane.

This uses Java generics so it can be applied to any object.
